      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <div class="ingredients">
          <ul>
              <li>14-16 oz. loaf Italian bread</li>
              <li>3/4 lb. bulk pork sausage, crumbled</li>
              <li>1 1/3 cups chopped fennel bulb</li>
              <li>1 1/3 cups sliced leeks</li>
              <li>1 1/3 cups chopped onion</li>
              <li>3 Tbsp. chopped fresh sage</li>
              <li>2 Tbsp. chopped fresh thyme</li>
              <li>1 Tbsp. chopped fresh rosemary</li>
              <li>Kosher salt</li>
              <li>Ground black pepper</li>
              <li>2 cups turkey or chicken broth, more as needed</li>
              <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
              <li>1/4 cup melted, unsalted butter or extra virgin olive oil</li>
              <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
              <li>vegetable oil or cooking spray, for baking dish</li>
          </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <div class="instructions">
          <ol>
              <li>Tear or cut the bread into 3/4 inch pieces until you have 8 to 10 cups. If working a day ahead, lay the pieces out on a rack and leave them uncovered on the counter to dry overnight. Otherwise, spread the bread out on a rimmed baking sheet and bake in a 275 F oven, stirring every 10 minutes or so, until it is crisp and mostly dry; it will continue to dry a bit as it cools. Oven-drying time will vary from 15 to 45 minutes, depending on the initial moisture content of the bread.</li>
              <li>In a large skillet, cook bacon or sausage over medium heat, stirring occasionally until browned and fully cooked. Add the chopped fennel, leeks, and onions and cook, stirring occasionally until they're slightly softened but still have some crunch. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.</li>
              <li>Add the bread to the large mixing bowl, along with the sage, thyme, and rosemary, and toss well. Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
              <li>Pour 1 1/2 cups of broth, plus white wine, over the stuffing. If the liquid isn't immediately absorbed and pools at the bottom, you have enough. Toss the mixture occasionally for a few minutes until the liquid is absorbed. The bread crumbs may initially feel wet on the outside while remaining dry on the inside, but this will even out as the stuffing cooks.</li>
              <li>If the bread immediately sucks up the initial 2 cups of liquid, add another 1/2 cup of broth and taste the mixture. The bread should be moist but not soggy. Add another 1/2 cup of broth if necessary.</li>
              <li>Taste the mixture and add salt and pepper as needed. If the mixture doesn't taste as rich as you'd like, add enough melted butter or olive oil to suit your taste. Once you're satisfied with the flavor of the mixture, stir in the beaten eggs.</li>
              <li>Heat the oven to 375 F. Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish with oil or cooking spray. Spread the stuffing in the dish, cover tightly with foil, and bake until heated through, about 30 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to bake until the top is lightly browned and crisp, another 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
          </ol>
